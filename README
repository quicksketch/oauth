Introduction
============
OAuth implements the OAuth classes for use with Drupal and acts as a support
module for other modules that wish to use OAuth.

OAuth Client flow:
The callback to be used is /oauth/authorized/% where % is the id of the consumer
used by the client. We need the id of the consumer to be able to find the token
correctly.

Installation
============
The OAuth library is out of the module. To set it up, just download twitter.lib.php from
http://oauth.googlecode.com/svn/code/php into your libraries directory (normally sites/all/libraries)
so its final location is sites/all/libraries/oauth/OAuth.php

To verify that it has been installed correctly, view the Status Report at
http://yoursite/admin/reports/status.
